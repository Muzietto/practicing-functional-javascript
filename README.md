# Practicing Functional TypeScript

## Purpose

Simplify software complexity by practicing functional programming in TypeScript. Functional programming with pure functions helps reduce complexity, making code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Approach

- **Functional TypeScript:** Solve problems using core JavaScript and TypeScript features with a focus on functional programming.
- **Built-in Methods:** Prioritize using JavaScript's built-in functions and TypeScript's type system to implement solutions without relying on external libraries.

## Exercises

This repository contains several exercises focused on functional TypeScript:

1. Hello World
2. Two Fer
3. Resistor Color
4. Resistor Color Duo
5. Resistor Color Trio
6. Gigasecond
7. RNA Transcription
8. Space Age

## Why Functional Programming?

Functional programming is about simplifying complexity by breaking down problems into pure, composable functions. This repository is designed to help you practice functional programming concepts in TypeScript by solving real-world problems.

## How to Solve Exercises

- **Use Built-in Methods:** Leverage JavaScript's and TypeScript's built-in methods for functional programming.
- **Emphasize Purity:** Focus on creating pure functions that are easy to test and reason about.
- **Ensure Immutability:** Write code that avoids mutating data, preferring immutable data structures and operations.
